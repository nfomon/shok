1. Run commands synchronously with redirected I/O

2. Pragmas e.g. #!VERSION

3. Implement objects

4. Implement literals (and a few hardcoded objects that support them)

5. Basic expressions should work

6. New statements

Eventually:
- Unicode support
- instead of "repeat" use "loop" again, e.g. "loop n times"
